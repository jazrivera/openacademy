* Identification Type
* Identification Number

This behavior is a common requirement for some latam countries like Argentina and Chile. If your localization has this requirements then you need to depend on this module and define in your localization module the identifications types that are used in your country. Generally these types of identifications are defined by the government authorities that regulate the fiscal operations. For example:

* AFIP in Argentina defines DNI, CUIT (vat for legal entities), CUIL (vat for natural person), and another 80 valid identification types.

Each identification holds this information:

* name: short name of the identification
* description: could be the same short name or a long name
* country_id: the country where this identification belongs
* is_vat: identify this record as the corresponding VAT for the specific country.
* sequence: let us to sort the identification types depending on the ones that are most used.
* active: we can activate/inactivate identifications to make it easier to our customers

In order to make this module compatible for multi-company environments where we have companies that does not need/support this requirement, we have added generic identification types and generic rules to manage the contact information and make it transparent for the user when only use the VAT as we formerly know.

Generic Identifications:

* VAT: The Fiscal Tax Identification or VAT number, by default will be selected as identification type so the user will only need to add the related vat number.
* Passport
* Foreign ID (Foreign National Document)

Rules when creating a new partner: We will only see the identification types that are meaningful, taking into account these rules:

* If the partner have not country address set: Will show the generic identification types plus the ones defined in the partner's related company country (If the partner has not specific company then will show the identification types related to the current user company)

* If the partner has country address : will show the generic identification types plus the ones defined for the country of the partner.

When creating a new company, will set to the related partner always the related country is_vat identification type.

All the defined identification types can be reviewed and activate/deactivate in ""Contacts / Configuration / Identification Type"" menu.

This module is compatible with base_vat module in order to be able to validate VAT numbers for each country that have or not have the possibility to manage multiple identification types.

fiscal Invoicing which is already operational) are brought by more than 15 
additional modules of the Brazilian Launchpad localization project

extra addons branch. Those modules aim at not breaking with the remarkable 
Odoo modularity, this is why they are numerous but small. One of the 
reasons for maintaining those modules apart is that Brazilian Localization 
leaders need commit rights agility to complete the localization as companies 
fund the remaining legal requirements (such as soon fiscal ledgers, 
accounting SPED, fiscal SPED and PAF ECF that are still missing as September 
2011). Those modules are also strictly licensed under AGPL V3 and today don't

EU Mini One Stop Shop (MOSS) VAT for telecommunications, broadcasting and electronic services
=============================================================================================

As of January 1rst, 2015, telecommunications, broadcasting
and electronic services sold within the European Union
have to be always taxed in the country where the customer
belongs. In order to simplify the application of this EU
directive, the Mini One Stop Shop (MOSS) registration scheme
allows businesses to make a unique tax declaration.

This module makes it possible by helping with the creation
of the required EU fiscal positions and taxes in order to
automatically apply and record the required taxes.

This module installs a wizard to help setup fiscal positions
and taxes for selling electronic services inside EU.

The wizard lets you select:
 - the EU countries to which you are selling these
   services
 - your national VAT tax for services, to be mapped
   to the target country's tax
 - optionally: a template fiscal position, in order
   to copy the account mapping. Should be your
   existing B2C Intra-EU fiscal position. (defaults
   to no account mapping)
 - optionally: an account to use for collecting the
   tax amounts (defaults to the account used by your
   national VAT tax for services)

It creates the corresponding fiscal positions and taxes,
automatically applicable for EU sales with a customer
in the selected countries.
The wizard can be run again for adding more countries.

Functional
----------

In some Latinamerica countries, including Argentina and Chile, some accounting transactions like invoices and vendor bills are classified by a document types defined by the government fiscal authorities (In Argentina case AFIP, Chile case SII).

This module is intended to be extended by localizations in order to manage these document types and is an essential information that needs to be displayed in the printed reports and that needs to be easily identified, within the set of invoices as well of account moves.

Each document type have their own rules and sequence number, this last one is integrated with the invoice number and journal sequence in order to be easy for the localization user. In order to support or not this document types a Journal has a new option that lets to use document or not.

Technical
---------

If your localization needs this logic will then need to add this module as dependency and in your localization module extend:

* extend company's _localization_use_documents() method.
* create the data of the document types that exists for the specific country. The document type has a country field

This module add accounting features for the Argentinian localization, which represent the minimal configuration needed for a company  to operate in Argentina and under the AFIP (Administración Federal de Ingresos Públicos) regulations and guidelines.

Follow the next configuration steps for Production:

1. Go to your company and configure your VAT number and AFIP Responsibility Type
2. Go to Accounting / Settings and set the Chart of Account that you will like to use.
3. Create your Sale journals taking into account AFIP POS info.

Demo data for testing:

* 3 companies were created, one for each AFIP responsibility type with the respective Chart of Account installed. Choose the company that fix you in order to make tests:

  * (AR) Responsable Inscripto
  * (AR) Exento
  * (AR) Monotributo

* Journal sales configured to Pre printed and Expo invoices in all companies
* Invoices and other documents examples already validated in “(AR) Responsable Inscripto” company
* Partners example for the different responsibility types:

  * ADHOC (IVA Responsable Inscripto)
  * Consejo Municipal Rosario (IVA Sujeto Exento)
  * Gritti (Monotributo)
  * Cerro Castor. IVA Liberado in Zona Franca
  * Expresso (Cliente del Exterior)
  * Odoo (Proveedor del Exterior)

Highlights:

* Chart of account will not be automatically installed, each CoA Template depends on the AFIP Responsibility of the company, you will need to install the CoA for your needs.
* No sales journals will be generated when installing a CoA, you will need to configure your journals manually.
* The Document type will be properly pre selected when creating an invoice depending on the fiscal responsibility of the issuer and receiver of the document and the related journal.
* A CBU account type has been added and also CBU Validation

* Chart of Account: one for each AFIP responsibility that is related to a legal entity:

  * Responsable Inscripto (RI)
  * Exento (EX)
  * Monotributo (Mono)

* Argentinian Taxes and Account Tax Groups (VAT taxes with the existing aliquots and other types)
* AFIP Responsibility Types
* Fiscal Positions (in order to map taxes)
* Legal Documents Types in Argentina

Re-implement Odoo's file import system:

* Server side, the previous system forces most of the logic into the
  client which duplicates the effort (between clients), makes the
  import system much harder to use without a client (direct RPC or
  other forms of automation) and makes knowledge about the
  import/export system much harder to gather as it is spread over
  3+ different projects.

* In a more extensible manner, so users and partners can build their
  own front-end to import from other file formats (e.g. OpenDocument
  files) which may be simpler to handle in their work flow or from
  their data production sources.

* In a module, so that administrators and users of Odoo who do not
  need or want an online import can avoid it being available to users.

Enter the parameters of your POP/IMAP account(s), and any incoming emails on
these accounts will be automatically downloaded into your Odoo system. All
POP3/IMAP-compatible servers are supported, included those that require an
encrypted SSL/TLS connection.

This can be used to easily create email-based workflows for many email-enabled Odoo documents, such as:

    * CRM Leads/Opportunities
    * CRM Claims
    * Project Issues
    * Project Tasks

Just install the relevant application, and you can assign any of these document
types (Leads, Project Issues) to your incoming email accounts. New emails will
automatically spawn new documents of the chosen type, so it's a snap to create a
mailbox-to-Odoo integration. Even better: these documents directly act as mini
conversations synchronized by email. You can reply from within Odoo, and the
answers will automatically be collected when they come back, and attached to the
same *conversation* document.

For more specific needs, you may also assign custom-defined actions
(technically: Server Actions) to be triggered for each incoming mail.

This module defines a chart of account for Switzerland (Swiss PME/KMU 2015), taxes and enables the generation of ISR when you print an invoice or send it by mail.

An ISR will be generated if you specify the information it needs :
    - The bank account you expect to be paid on must be set, and have a valid postal reference.
    - Your invoice must have been set assigned a bank account to receive its payment
      (this can be done manually, but a default value is automatically set if you have defined a bank account).
    - You must have set the postal references of your bank.
    - Your invoice must be in EUR or CHF (as ISRs do not accept other currencies)

The generation of the ISR is automatic if you meet the previous criteria.

Here is how it works:
    - Printing the invoice will trigger the download of two files: the invoice, and its ISR
    - Clicking the 'Send by mail' button will attach two files to your draft mail : the invoice, and the corresponding ISR.

Fiscal positions
----------------

When considering taxes to be applied, it is the province where the delivery occurs that matters.
Therefore we decided to implement the most common case in the fiscal positions: delivery is the
responsibility of the vendor and done at the customer location.

Some examples:

1) You have a customer from another province and you deliver to his location.
On the customer, set the fiscal position to his province.

2) You have a customer from another province. However this customer comes to your location
with their truck to pick up products. On the customer, do not set any fiscal position.

3) An international vendor doesn't charge you any tax. Taxes are charged at customs
by the customs broker. On the vendor, set the fiscal position to International.

4) An international vendor charge you your provincial tax. They are registered with your
position.

This module applies to companies based in France mainland. It doesn't apply to
companies based in the DOM-TOMs (Guadeloupe, Martinique, Guyane, Réunion, Mayotte).

This localisation module creates the VAT taxes of type 'tax included' for purchases
(it is notably required when you use the module 'hr_expense'). Beware that these
'tax included' VAT taxes are not managed by the fiscal positions provided by this
module (because it is complex to manage both 'tax excluded' and 'tax included'
scenarios in fiscal positions).

This localisation module doesn't properly handle the scenario when a France-mainland
company sells services to a company based in the DOMs. We could manage it in the
fiscal positions, but it would require to differentiate between 'product' VAT taxes
and 'service' VAT taxes. We consider that it is too 'heavy' to have this by default
in l10n_fr; companies that sell services to DOM-based companies should update the
configuration of their taxes and fiscal positions manually.

This module will automatically reserve the picking from stock when a sales order is confirmed
=============================================================================================
Upon confirmation of a sales order or when quantities are added,
the picking that reserves from stock will be reserved if the
necessary quantities are available.

In the simplest configurations, this is an easy way of working:
first come, first served.  However, when not installed, you can
use manual reservation or run the schedulers where the system
will take into account the expected date and the priority.

If this automatic reservation would reserve too much, you can
still unreserve a picking.

VAT validation for Partner's VAT numbers.
=========================================

After installing this module, values entered in the VAT field of Partners will
be validated for all supported countries. The country is inferred from the
2-letter country code that prefixes the VAT number, e.g. ``BE0477472701``
will be validated using the Belgian rules.

There are two different levels of VAT number validation:
--------------------------------------------------------
    * By default, a simple off-line check is performed using the known validation
      rules for the country, usually a simple check digit. This is quick and 
      always available, but allows numbers that are perhaps not truly allocated,
      or not valid anymore.

    * When the ""VAT VIES Check"" option is enabled (in the configuration of the user's
      Company), VAT numbers will be instead submitted to the online EU VIES
      database, which will truly verify that the number is valid and currently
      allocated to a EU company. This is a little bit slower than the simple
      off-line check, requires an Internet connection, and may not be available
      all the time. If the service is not available or does not support the
      requested country (e.g. for non-EU countries), a simple check will be performed
      instead.

Supported countries currently include EU countries, and a few non-EU countries
such as Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Norway or Russia. For unsupported countries,
only the country code will be validated.

This module is specially made to manage the accounting functionality
according to the Dutch best practice.

This module contains the Dutch Chart of Accounts and the VAT schema.
This schema is made for the most common Companies and therefore suitable
to be used for almost every Company.

The VAT accounts are linked promptly to generate the required reports. Examples
of this reports intercommunitaire transactions.

After installation of this module the configuration will be activated.
Select the Chart of Accounts named ""Netherlands - Accounting"".

Hereafter entering the name of the Company, total digits of Chart of Accounts,

base,model,"ir.module.module,description",base.module_auth_ldap,"Adds support for authentication by LDAP server.
===============================================
This module allows users to login with their LDAP username and password, and
will automatically create Odoo users for them on the fly.

**Note:** This module only work on servers that have Python's ``python-ldap`` module installed.

Configuration:
--------------
After installing this module, you need to configure the LDAP parameters in the
General Settings menu. Different companies may have different
LDAP servers, as long as they have unique usernames (usernames need to be unique
in Odoo, even across multiple companies).

Anonymous LDAP binding is also supported (for LDAP servers that allow it), by
simply keeping the LDAP user and password empty in the LDAP configuration.
This does not allow anonymous authentication for users, it is only for the master
LDAP account that is used to verify if a user exists before attempting to
authenticate it.

Securing the connection with STARTTLS is available for LDAP servers supporting
it, by enabling the TLS option in the LDAP configuration.

For further options configuring the LDAP settings, refer to the ldap.conf
manpage: manpage:`ldap.conf(5)`.

Security Considerations:
------------------------
Users' LDAP passwords are never stored in the Odoo database, the LDAP server
is queried whenever a user needs to be authenticated. No duplication of the
password occurs, and passwords are managed in one place only.

Odoo does not manage password changes in the LDAP, so any change of password
should be conducted by other means in the LDAP directory directly (for LDAP users).

It is also possible to have local Odoo users in the database along with
LDAP-authenticated users (the Administrator account is one obvious example).

Here is how it works:
---------------------
    * The system first attempts to authenticate users against the local Odoo
      database;
    * if this authentication fails (for example because the user has no local
      password), the system then attempts to authenticate against LDAP;

As LDAP users have blank passwords by default in the local Odoo database
(which means no access), the first step always fails and the LDAP server is
queried to do the authentication.

Enabling STARTTLS ensures that the authentication query to the LDAP server is
encrypted.

User Template:
--------------
In the LDAP configuration on the General Settings, it is possible to select a *User
Template*. If set, this user will be used as template to create the local users
whenever someone authenticates for the first time via LDAP authentication. This
allows pre-setting the default groups and menus of the first-time users.

**Warning:** if you set a password for the user template, this password will be
         assigned as local password for each new LDAP user, effectively setting
         a *master password* for these users (until manually changed). You
         usually do not want this. One easy way to setup a template user is to
         login once with a valid LDAP user, let Odoo create a blank local
         user with the same login (and a blank password), then rename this new
         user to a username that does not exist in LDAP, and setup its groups

Ce module permet de générer le fichier FEC tel que définit par `l'arrêté du 29
Juillet 2013 <http://legifrance.gouv.fr/eli/arrete/2013/7/29/BUDE1315492A/jo/texte>`
portant modification des dispositions de l'article A. 47 A-1 du
livre des procédures fiscales.

Cet arrêté prévoit l'obligation pour les sociétés ayant une comptabilité
informatisée de pouvoir fournir à l'administration fiscale un fichier
regroupant l'ensemble des écritures comptables de l'exercice. Le format de ce
fichier, appelé *FEC*, est définit dans l'arrêté.

Le détail du format du FEC est spécifié dans le bulletin officiel des finances publiques `BOI-CF-IOR-60-40-20-20131213 <http://bofip.impots.gouv.fr/bofip/ext/pdf/createPdfWithAnnexePermalien/BOI-CF-IOR-60-40-20-20131213.pdf?doc=9028-PGP&identifiant=BOI-CF-IOR-60-40-20-20131213>` du 13 Décembre 2013. Ce module implémente le fichier
FEC au format texte et non au format XML, car le format texte sera facilement
lisible et vérifiable par le comptable en utilisant un tableur.

La structure du fichier FEC généré par ce module a été vérifiée avec le logiciel
*Test Compta Demat* version 1_00_05 disponible sur
`le site de la direction générale des finances publiques <http://www.economie.gouv.fr/dgfip/outil-test-des-fichiers-des-ecritures-comptables-fec>`
en utilisant une base de donnée Odoo réelle.

Configuration
=============

Aucune configuration n'est nécessaire.

Utilisation
===========

Pour générer le *FEC*, allez dans le menu *Accounting > Reporting > French Statements > FEC* qui va démarrer l'assistant de génération du FEC.

**RELACIÓN ENTRE EL PCGE Y LA LEGISLACIÓN TRIBUTARIA:**

Este PCGE ha sido preparado como una herramienta de carácter contable, para acumular información que 
requiere ser expuesta en el cuerpo de los estados financieros o en las notas a dichos estados. Esa acumulación se 
efectúa en los libros o registros contables, cuya denominación y naturaleza depende de las actividades que se 
efectúen, y que permiten acciones de verificación, control y seguimiento. Las NIIF completas y la NIIF PYMES no
contienen prescripciones sobre teneduría de libros, y consecuentemente, sobre los libros y otros registros 
de naturaleza contable. Por otro lado, si bien es cierto la contabilidad es también un insumo, dentro de otros, para 
labores de cumplimiento tributario, este PCGE no ha sido elaborado para satisfacer prescripciones tributarias ni su 
verificación. No obstante ello, donde no hubo oposición entre la contabilidad financiera prescrita por las NIIF y
la legislación tributaria, este PCGE ha incluido subcuentas, divisionarias y sub divisionarias, para
distinguir componentes con validez tributaria, dentro del conjunto de componentes que corresponden a una
perspectiva contable íntegramente. Por lo tanto, este PCGE no debe ser considerado en ningún aspecto
como una guía con propósitos distintos del contable.","Minimal set of accounts to start to work in Perú.

------------------

### Infinitely flexible. Incredibly easy to use.


Odoo's collaborative and realtime <a href=""https://www.odoo.com/page/project-management"">open source project management</a>
helps your team get work done. Keep track of everything, from the big picture
to the minute details, from the customer contract to the billing.

Designed to fit your own process
--------------------------------

Organize projects around your own processes. Work on tasks and issues using the
kanban view, schedule tasks using the gantt chart and control deadlines in the
calendar view. Every project may have it's own stages allowing teams to
optimize their job.

Easy to use
-----------

Get organized as fast as you can think. The easy-to-use interface takes no time
to learn, and every action is instantaneous, so there’s nothing standing
between you and your sweet productive flow.

Work Together
-------------

### Real time chats, document sharing, email integration

Use open chatter to communicate with your team or customers and share comments
and documents on tasks and issues. Integrate discussion fast with the email
integration.

Talk to others users or customers with the website live chat feature.

Collaborative Writing
---------------------

### The power of etherpad, inside your tasks

Collaboratively edit the same specifications or meeting minutes right inside
the application. The incorporated etherpad feature allows several people to
work on the same tasks, at the same time.

This is very efficient for scrum meetings, meeting minutes or complex
specifications. Every user has their own color and you can replay the whole
creation of the content.

Get Work Done
-------------

Get alerts on followed events to stay up to date with what interests you. Use
instant green/red visual indicators to scan through what has been done and what
requires your attention.

Timesheets, Contracts & Invoicing
---------------------------------

Projects are automatically integrated with customer contracts allowing you to
invoice based on time & materials and record timesheets easily.

Track Issues
------------

Single out the issues that arise in a project in order to have a better focus
on resolving them. Integrate customer interaction on every issue and get
accurate reports on your team's performance.
